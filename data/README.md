## Datasets 

### Criteria:
1. resembles Wikipedia articles in style and structure
2. convers domain of high schools
3. most importantly, has varying and quantifiable level of bias

### Candidate 1:
#### Yelp Review Full

| Access | Source | Approx. Size | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Yelp Dataset License (non-commercial) | [Hugging Face `yelp_review_full`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yelp/yelp_review_full) | ~650k reviews in train split | Does include localized reviews of high schools, however the tone is informal and length is short, does not match Wikipedia at all. |


### Candidate 2:
#### Misinfo-General (filtered NELA-GT clone)

| Access | Source | Approx. Size | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (gated access) | [Hugging Face `ioverho/misinfo-general`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ioverho/misinfo-general) | 4.16M articles | Massive collection of news articles in formal tone with pre-computed bias tags. Went through multiple stages of filtering and deduplication, inheriting some filtering bias. As the full NELA-GT dataset is [deaccessioned](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AMCV2H), this is the only remaining sample. |


### Candidate 3:
#### NELA-PS (News Landscape Dataset Pink-Slime)

| Access | Source | Approx. Size | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CC BY-NC 4.0 | [Harvard Dataverse NELA-PS](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YHWTFC) | 7.9M articles, 1093 PS sources | Pink Slime "PS" refers to low quality, partisan, often outsourced news networks that try to disguise as local newspapers. This is as opposed to NELA-GT "Ground Truth", a collection of international news sources, which are more mainstream and biased. |

### Overall:
Promising candidates are the NELA-GT clone and NELA-PS dataset.

Collecing a sample of 30 articles relating to high schools from each of these 2 sets, we ranked each in a 
scale of 0-3 in terms of how much bias they exhibit.\
Optimally, the datasets would have a consistent, detectable, and varying bias that would be enough to be 
used as a training signal.

### Findings:
Exact data analysis is in [```./ps_v_gt_sample_analysis.txt```](./ps_v_gt_sample_analysis.txt)\
In summary, **bias is detectable and consistent only in the GT dataset.**\
Both human and AI scoring detected that the GT articles carry significantly more and more variable bias than the 
PS articles, which consistently show 0 or 1 out of 3. This is most likely because the PS articles on high schools\
are mainly auto-generated statistics (ex. graduation rates, enrollment counts, etc), and very little writing apart from that. However, the GT articles actually carry genuine editorial content that carry bias.
